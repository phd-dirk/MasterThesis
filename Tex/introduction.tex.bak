\chapter{Introduction}
The pertubative expansion in QCD is known to lead to a divergent series, which is at best asymptotic. The asymptotic behavior of the pertubative series manifest itself in the appearance of singularities for its Borel transform. Those singularities connected with renormalisation are termed renormalons.

Die Ambiguit채t tritt dadurch auf, dass die OPE die Funktion in perturbativen Anteil und Operator Korrekturen splittet. Dieses Splitting hat Ambiguit채ten, die sich gegenseitig Aufheben m체ssen, weil die komplette Funktion gerade keine Ambiguit채t haben kann, da sie physikalisch (d.h. im allgemeinen messbar) ist.
The presence of infrared (IR) renormalons, renormalons on the positive real Borel axis, leads to ambiguities in the definition fo the full function. Associated with the ambiguities is the appearance of higher-dimensional operator corrections, the so-called \textit{QCD condensates}, such that the full function is unambiguous. The operators that display renormalon ambiguities are a subset of those that arise in the framework of the operator product expansion (OPE).
\par 
Limiting ourselves to correlation functions of vector or axialvector currents with respect to the QCD vacuum, the lowest-lying IR renormalon pole is associated to the vacuum matrix element of one dimension-4 operator, the gluon condensate. The next-closest singularity then is found to correspond to the dimension-6 triple gluon condensate and a set of dimension-6 4-quark condensates. It is these latter 4-quark condensates that we intend to investigate in more detail in the present work.
\par
In the upcoming chapter we want to provide the fundamentals of renormalization in QCD. Our main issue will be to present one-loop calculations of anomalous-dimension matrices $\gamma$ for four-quark operators. In addition to the computations of the anomalous dimension matrix we want to give the basics of the renormalisation group equation (RGE) and test it for the from us calculated anomalous dimension matrix.
